## Final Notes

### Accuracy
All information in this inventory is based on:
- Static code analysis (file structure, line counts)
- Configuration files (Hydra configs, pyproject.toml)
- Git history (if available)
- Test files and documentation

This is a **snapshot as of October 26, 2025** and may require updates as code evolves.

### Gaps
The inventory does NOT include:
- Runtime behavior or performance data
- Detailed algorithm implementations
- User documentation (beyond architecture)
- Deployment procedures
- Security assessment

### Recommendations
- Review and validate critical findings with team
- Update inventory quarterly
- Keep documents with codebase in version control
- Use as foundation for architectural documentation
