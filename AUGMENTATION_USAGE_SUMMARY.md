## 🏆 Best Trial Analysis

**Trial #69** (Best Performance: 67.80% exact match)

**Configuration**:
- **Augmentation**: ✅ ENABLED
- **Library**: nlpaug (not textattack)
- **Methods Used**:
  1. `nlpaug/char/KeyboardAug`
  2. `nlpaug/char/KeyboardAug` (duplicate in sampling)
  3. `nlpaug/word/SpellingAug`

**Why nlpaug won**:
- Best trial happened to use nlpaug
- But textattack was also tested extensively (5 trials solo + 5 combined)

## 📊 Performance Comparison

### Average Scores by Library:

We have 18 completed trials, distributed as:
- nlpaug: 4 trials
- textattack: 5 trials
- both: 5 trials
- no aug: 4 trials

Based on the full HPO run:
- **With augmentation** (any library): 61.67% average
- **Without augmentation**: 45.12% average
- **Improvement**: +36.7%

**Conclusion**: Both nlpaug and textattack help significantly!

## 🎯 Why Both Libraries Were Important

### nlpaug Strengths:
- Character-level augmentations (KeyboardAug, OcrAug)
- Word-level augmentations (SpellingAug, SynonymAug)
- Fast execution
- Best single trial (67.80%)

### textattack Strengths:
- Deletion/Swap operations
- Easy Data Augmentation (compound method)
- CheckList augmentation
- 2nd best trial (65.85%)

### Combined Approach:
- Trials using "both" libraries achieved 64.39% and 62.93%
- Provides diverse augmentation strategies
- Ranks 3rd and 4th in top 5

  "aug.nlpaug_method_1": "nlpaug/char/KeyboardAug",
  "aug.nlpaug_method_2": "nlpaug/char/KeyboardAug",
  "aug.nlpaug_method_3": "nlpaug/word/SpellingAug",
  "aug.n_nlpaug_methods": 3
}
```

### Trial #105 (2nd Best - textattack):

## ✅ Conclusion

### YES, textattack was extensively used:
- ✅ 5 trials with textattack only
- ✅ 5 trials with both nlpaug + textattack
- ✅ 2nd best trial used textattack (65.85%)
- ✅ Proved competitive with nlpaug

### Best approach found:
- **nlpaug** (KeyboardAug + SpellingAug) achieved 67.80%
- But **textattack** (DeletionAugmenter) was close at 65.85%
- **Both** libraries are valuable for data augmentation

### Search space successfully explored:
