# PSY Agents NO-AUG

All project documentation now resides in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.

Primary entry points:
- `docs/README.md` – project overview and repository structure
- `docs/QUICK_START.md` – quick setup and usage guide
- `docs/CI_CD_SETUP.md` – CI/CD pipeline reference
- `docs/TESTING.md` – testing strategy and commands

Additional guides are available alongside these files for setup, training
infrastructure, data pipeline details, and CLI/Makefile usage.

Model implementations for the four supported architectures live in
`src/psy_agents_noaug/architectures/` (`criteria`, `evidence`, `share`, `joint`).
